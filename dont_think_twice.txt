walking down that|long lonesome|road, babe|

Look out your|window and|I'll be gone|
try and|make me change my|mind and stay|
once loved a|woman, a|child I am told|I
could have done better|but|I don't mind|

You're the|reason that I'm|trav'lin'|on, but
We never|did too much|talkin' any-|way
gave her my|heart but she|wanted my|soul
you just kind of|wasted all my|precious|time,but
