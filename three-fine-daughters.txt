+Chorus~width=4~lyrics=1
G|C G|G|D G
Breaking hearts in|Halifax county, the|three fine daughters of|Farmer Brown

G|C G|G|D G
Turning heads of the|boys in the schoolyard|catching whistles from the|men downtown

C|G|%|D G
No one knows where|they went a-rowin', the|three fine daughters of|Farmer Brown

C|G|%|D/F# Em
They didn't know that the|rocks on the river be the|three sisters island where|they all drowned

Widower Brown had a|girl named Nellie|She was the oldest and|toughest of three
Old man Brown had a|girl named Dottie|The middle button and the most|vain of the three
Farmer Brown had a|girl named Becca|She was the youngest and most|reverent of all
One day the three with|nothing in common|Spied upon an a-|bandoned rowboat
Some may recall the|singing of the sirens|Lured in the sailors who'd|wreck and drown

She would take her daddy's|well sharpened sickle, and|And carve "Kill Men" in a|sycamore tree
She'd take her daddy's|fat leather boot strap|And whip anyone who'd call her|Dorothy
She would take her daddy's|King James Bible|And go study scripture at the|brethren hall
Maybe their sense of ad-|venture had pushed|The three young girls to set their|ship afloat
Some say they still hear the|fightin' and the flirtin' and the|Preachin' of the daughters of|Farmer Brown

The men came a-courtin' but|she'd keep her distance|Never cracked a smile just|played it coy
The men would fawn her and|she would repay them|And peck 'em where they'd find it|safe to kiss
The men would avoid her 'cuz|she would condemn them|For cussing' and drinkin' and|chasing the Browns
They didn't know the|strength of the river|The Merciless current that|pulled them down

Am|C|G|C
Some say she's as|tender as a petal|She'd act tough 'cuz her daddy|wanted a boy
Like the barn or the porch or the|upstairs parlor|Anywhere that'd keep 'em from her|father's fist
She'd say "repent and|join God forever|The pleasure of sin's not as|good as it sounds"
Maybe it was due to the|weight of their denim|But the three girls bodies were|never found
