I haven't seen my|father in some|time|But his

Em|C|D|D
face is always|staring back at|me|His

Am|Em|G|C
heavy|hands hang at the ends of|my arms|And my

C|G|C|G
colors|change like the sea||


But I don't worry much about time lost
I'm not gunning for the dreams I couldn't find
'Cause he taught me how to walk the best that I can
On the road I've left behind

[Chorus 1]
                    Em
But most of all
      D                  G
He taught me to forgive
             C                G
How to keep a cool head
             D                           G
How to love the one you're with
                       Em
And when I'm far into the distance
              D                          G
And the pushing comes to shove
      C                                  G
To remember what comes back
                  D                      G
When you give away your love
                          D            D
Give away your love
                 C                     G
When you give your love away
                         D         D        b c d b g      b c d e d b g       
Give away your love

[Verse 3]
I haven't heard my mother's voice in a while
But her words are always falling out my mouth
My mind and spirit are at odds sometimes
And they fight like the north and the south

But I still care enough to bear the weight
Of the heaviness to which my heart is tethered
She taught me how to be strong and say goodbye
And that love is forever
